        <div class='description'><p>Hello everyone. My name is Vlad Zborovets and i would love to become a software engineer. I'm from Ukraine, came here about 6 years ago and didn't know any English, after taking some English courses i've enrolled in College for Criminal Justice Major, I've got my degree but haven't felt passion about that field. After COVID hit and we were locked up, i've decided to try coding by myself, i've learned little by little, and discovered that there is immersive coding courses 'BOOT CAMPS'. After month of researching about Boot Camps i've found "General Assembly" and decided to enroll for immersive coding cohort. It was the best desicion in my life, after 3 month of hard learning and sleepless night I reliazed that coding is a real passion i've been looking for. Throught immersive course, we started to learn fundamental coding and then moved into more advanced one. General Assembly gave me knowledge in both FrontEnd and BackEnd parts of stack. I've become familiar with languages such as: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python as well as frameworks and libraries  such as: React, Jquery, Express, aslo a Data Base technologies such as: Django, MongoDB, postgreSQL. After 420+ hours of studing I'm ready to move on and work as a Software engineer. I'm open to learn new technologies, new coding lenguages, frameworks, etc..

                    This is my first ever porject I've done. In this project i've used my knowledge of plain JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</li>



                    <li><a href="https://vlad-project2.herokuapp.com/journal">Travel Journal</a>
                        This is my second project. In this project i've used my knowledge of EJS and Express. In this project i've used back end for the first time.</li>


                        <li><a href="https://nyapp-frontend.herokuapp.com/">New York App</a>
                            This is my third project overall but also my first group project. Basically, it was cool to work in a group but as it was first time ever it was kinda frustrated to split work and do time managment. However, we figured all out and did a good job on spliting tusks and tuckling problems. For that project we used FrontEnd and BackEnd as well. For BackEnd we used MongoDB and for FrontEnd we used JavaScript library 'React'.</li>

                            <li><a href="https://natl-parks-r-us-front.herokuapp.com/">National Parks of the USA</a>
                                This is my fourth project, second group project, on this project we had group of three people. As me and my teammates had previous experince working in a groupe, we've taclked this project easier, and split work faster, we figured out all parts pretty quckly, had more communication and did stand ups couples time a day, to make sure everyone doing their job.</li>

                                <li><a href="http://cars-front-end.herokuapp.com/">Fastest cars</a>
                                    This is my final project, on this project i've use Django and React, also we supposted to learn a new language or framework, so i've choose CSS framework "Tailwind". At a first place, it seemed harder to me because this CSS have similar properties but different way of using them but after learning it deeper ive realized that this CSS framework much better and more powerful than previous one i've used. After completing a course, i feel pretty good with material we went over in a class, and i'm really exsited to have succesfully completed that course. </li></ul>
